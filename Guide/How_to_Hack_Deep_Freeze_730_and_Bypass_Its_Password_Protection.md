## Method 1: Change the System Date
 
One of the simplest ways to hack Deep Freeze 7.30 is to change the system date to a time before the software was installed. This works only on the evaluation version of Deep Freeze, not the enterprise version. To do this, follow these steps:
 
1. Reboot your computer and press F8 to enter the Advanced Boot Options menu.
2. Select Safe Mode with Command Prompt and press Enter.
3. At the command prompt, type `date` and press Enter.
4. Type a date before Deep Freeze was installed, such as `01/01/2000`, and press Enter.
5. Type `exit` and press Enter to restart your computer normally.
6. You should now be able to access the Deep Freeze icon on the system tray and disable or uninstall it without a password.

## Method 2: Use a Password Cracker
 
Another way to hack Deep Freeze 7.30 is to use a password cracker program that can brute-force the password of the software. This may take a long time depending on the complexity of the password and the speed of your computer. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Download a password cracker program such as John the Ripper or Hashcat from their official websites.
2. Extract the program to a folder on your computer or a USB drive.
3. Find the configuration file of Deep Freeze on your computer. It is usually located in `C:\Program Files\Faronics\Deep Freeze\Install C-0\DFC.ini`.
4. Copy the configuration file to the same folder as the password cracker program.
5. Open a command prompt window and navigate to the folder where you extracted the password cracker program.
6. Type the command to run the program with the configuration file as an input. For example, if you are using John the Ripper, type `john DFC.ini` and press Enter.
7. The program will start cracking the password of Deep Freeze. This may take several hours or days depending on the password strength and your computer performance.
8. Once the program finds the password, it will display it on the screen. Note down the password and use it to access Deep Freeze.

## Method 3: Remove the CMOS Battery
 
A third way to hack Deep Freeze 7.30 is to remove the CMOS battery from your computer's motherboard. This will reset your BIOS settings and allow you to boot from a USB drive or CD/DVD. You can then use a live Linux distribution or a Windows installation disc to access your hard drive and delete Deep Freeze files. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Shut down your computer and unplug it from the power source.
2. Open your computer case and locate the CMOS battery on your motherboard. It is usually a round silver coin-like battery.
3. Carefully remove the CMOS battery from its holder and set it aside for a few minutes.
4. Plug in your USB drive or CD/DVD that contains a live Linux distribution or a Windows installation disc.
5. Reinsert the CMOS battery into its holder and close your computer case.
6. Turn on your computer and press F12 or another key to enter the Boot Menu.
7. Select your USB drive or CD/DVD as the boot device and press Enter.
8. You should now be able to boot into Linux or Windows setup screen.
