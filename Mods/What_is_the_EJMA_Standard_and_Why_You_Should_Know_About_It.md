# What is the EJMA Standard and Why You Should Know About It
 
The EJMA Standard is a set of guidelines and recommendations for the proper selection and application of metallic bellows type expansion joints for safe and reliable piping and vessel installation. The Expansion Joint Manufacturers Association (EJMA) is a trade association that was founded in 1955 and has been publishing the EJMA Standard since 1986. The EJMA Standard is recognized throughout the world as the authority on metallic bellows expansion joints.

The EJMA Standard covers the design, fabrication, testing, and installation of expansion joints that have various convolution shapes and sizes. It also provides technical information on the materials, properties, and performance of expansion joints. The EJMA Standard is not a manufacturing standard or a quality assurance document, but rather a reference document that contains best practices and industry knowledge. The EJMA Standard is intended to be used in conjunction with other codes and specifications, such as the ASME B31.3 Piping Code or the ASME Pressure Vessel Code.
 
The EJMA Standard is updated periodically to reflect the latest technological advancements and research findings in the field of expansion joints. The most recent edition is the 10th Edition, which was published in 2016. The 10th Edition has several significant changes and improvements from the previous editions, such as:
 
- A new approach for the design of reinforced bellows, resulting in a modified set of equations for some stress components and for the spring rates.
- A simplified method for calculating the fatigue life of expansion joints based on a common set of fatigue curves.
- A revised equation for the axial movement per convolution of universal type expansion joints.
- An acceptable radial gap between equalizing/reinforcing rings and the root of convolution/bellows tangent.
- A distinction of thin versus thick bellows.
- A modification of benchmark table inputs and outputs with material class and correction factor.
- A revision of single bellows axial vibration constants.
- A clarification of definitions in the nomenclature section.
- An inclusion of both English and Metric units of measure.

The EJMA Standard is available in printed or e-reader format from the EJMA website[^1^]. Each printed copy comes with a Practical Guide to Expansion Joints, a pocket size primer based on the EJMA Standard. The e-book version can be downloaded to your PC, laptop, or tablet. The EJMA Standard is an invaluable resource for anyone who is involved in the design, manufacture, installation, or maintenance of metallic bellows expansion joints.
  
## Benefits of Metallic Bellows Expansion Joints
 
Metallic bellows expansion joints offer many benefits for piping systems that experience thermal expansion, contraction, vibration, or misalignment. Some of the benefits are:

- Vibration isolation: Metallic bellows can absorb and dampen the unwanted vibration in piping systems that can cause severe damage to the system and surrounding equipment. Vibration can be caused by pumps, compressors, turbines, engines, or other sources of mechanical energy. Metallic bellows can reduce the stress and fatigue on the piping components and increase their service life.
- Wide temperature and pressure ranges: Metallic bellows can handle a wide range of temperatures and pressures, from cryogenic to high-temperature applications, and from vacuum to high-pressure systems. Metallic bellows can convey liquids, solids, gases, or abrasive materials without compromising their integrity or performance. Metallic bellows can also withstand corrosive environments by using appropriate materials or linings.
- Space saving: Metallic bellows can take up far less space than piping bends and expansion loops that are required to accommodate thermal expansion and contraction. Metallic bellows can also eliminate the need for additional supports, anchors, or guides that are needed for rigid piping systems. Metallic bellows can provide flexibility in multiple directions, such as axial, lateral, angular, or torsional.
- Cost saving: Metallic bellows can reduce the overall cost of piping systems by simplifying the design, installation, and maintenance. Metallic bellows can reduce the number of joints, fittings, valves, and welds that are needed for rigid piping systems. Metallic bellows can also reduce the energy loss due to friction and pressure drop. Metallic bellows can also extend the service life of piping systems by preventing leaks, cracks, ruptures, or failures.

Metallic bellows expansion joints are an ideal solution for many piping applications that require flexibility, reliability, and durability. By following the EJMA Standard and other relevant codes and specifications, metallic bellows expansion joints can be designed and manufactured to meet the specific requirements of each piping system.
